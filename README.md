- 👋 Hi, I’m @JaioneAmigot. 
- I am currently a Data Science student focused on expanding and sharing my understanding of how data is collected, analyzed, and interpreted, using methods from statistics and machine learning. Using a variety of applicable models for large amounts of data, I will share my methods to interpret results and ultimately, facilitate the identification of actionable plans for organizations. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data anlytics projects written in either Python or R (RStudio).
